VISUAL ANALYSIS OF ATTACHED CROSS IMAGE
===========================================================================

Image Description:
- Grayscale microscopy/calibration image showing a cross (+) fiducial marker
- Dark/black region at top of image (substrate edge or margin)
- Cross marker etched/marked on lighter substrate surface
- Some diagonal shadowing artifacts visible in background

Cross Characteristics Observed:
- The cross is a standard "plus" (+) shape
- Located roughly in the center of the visible calibration area
- Cross outline appears as thin gray lines against the substrate
- The cross appears to be symmetric or nearly symmetric

Approximate Visual Measurements:
(Based on visual inspection - actual pixel measurements require image file)

Cross Center:
- Approximately centered horizontally in the visible lighter region
- Positioned in the middle-to-lower portion vertically (accounting for dark top region)

Half-Arm Length Estimates (relative proportions):
- Top arm:    Appears similar in length to bottom arm
- Bottom arm: Appears similar in length to top arm
- Left arm:   Appears similar in length to right arm
- Right arm:  Appears similar in length to left arm

Observed Arm Ratios (visual estimate):
- Left/Right ratio:   ~1.0 (arms appear horizontally symmetric)
- Top/Bottom ratio:   ~0.95-1.05 (arms appear vertically symmetric)
- Horizontal/Vertical: ~1.0 (cross appears square/balanced)

Notes:
- The cross appears to be a calibration/fiducial marker
- All four arms appear to be of similar length
- The cross is well-defined with clear edges
- Minor asymmetry may exist but is not visually obvious
